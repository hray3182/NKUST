## Topic Selection Journey

When starting this assignment, I faced a key question: What kind of problem is truly suitable for clustering?

I found that many common clustering assignment topics, such as the Iris and Wine datasets, actually have clear labels and are essentially classification problems that should be solved using supervised learning. Using clustering on these topics feels like "forcing clustering for the sake of using clustering."

I explored various possible applications: customer segmentation, hotspot detection, music classification, anomaly detection, etc. However, after deeper consideration, I found that many of these problems share a common issue: there are actually better solutions, or clustering is merely an auxiliary tool rather than the core method.

Ultimately, I chose image compression (K-means Color Quantization) for a simple reason:

1. This is clustering's purest application - K-means was originally designed for vector quantization, and image compression is its classic use case

2. The K value has clear practical meaning - It's not randomly guessing how many clusters to use, but directly corresponds to "how many colors to preserve," which affects compression ratio and visual quality

3. Results can be directly verified - Compression effects are immediately visible, requiring no complex evaluation metrics

4. No "better alternative methods" - For color quantization, clustering is the standard solution

This topic helped me understand: Good machine learning applications don't force data into an algorithm just to use it, but rather use the algorithm because it truly is the best tool for solving the problem.
